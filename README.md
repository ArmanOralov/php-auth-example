# PHP Authentication example
This is a very basic example on how to use PHP to authenticate the user login.
It implements two types of authentication:
- HTML page login, when the user arrives by index.php;
- Basic Authentication method, when accessing by api.php.
To test it, download, and start the php webserver with the default command line:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
To authenticate, use user 'admin' and password 'admin'.

The styles and sample page came from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
